## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0]

Initial public release.

- One client for every caller — AI agents, humans, backend services: `authorize` / `status` /
  `consume` / `requireApproval`, differing only in which API key or token you hold.
- `target` is required on every approval request (DIV Target Isolation) — there is no `"global"`
  default.
- Offline approval fallback (DIV §5a) with `reconcileOfflineApprovals`, plus trust-bundle
  load/verify helpers.
- Zero-knowledge policy tooling and CLI: `keygen`, `policy-encrypt`, `login`, `authorize`, `await`,
  `notify`, `verify`, `audit-verify`.
- Re-exports the zero-dependency `@intyga/verify` receipt verifier.
